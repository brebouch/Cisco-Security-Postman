[Cisco Threat Grid API Docs]()

A list of basic Threat Grid scripts can be found [here]().

Threat Grid has three primary uses:

1. [Submitting Samples]()
2. [Querying Threat Grid]()
3. [Curated Feeds]()
    

Most tasks that can be completed within the Threat Grid UI can be performed using APIs.

## 1.1. Receiving an API Key

The primary means of authentication is the Threat Grid API key. The `api_key` parameter identifies the user and authorizes their access to the API.

1. Login into the Threat Grid [console]().
2. Click your username in the upper right corner and scroll down to API
3. Click show and copy your API Key
4. Under “Can Download Sample Content Via API” select `True`
    

### 1.1.1. API Versions 2 and 3

Note

The main difference between api/v2 and api/v3 is that v2 is the original, and v3 is a newer, more modern generation of the Threat Grid APIs. However, api/v3 does not replace or supersede v2. Newer features are being added to api/v3 but api/v2 is still current. For example, api/v2 includes submissions, and v3 includes account management. For more information, see the [API docs.]()
