# Armorblox

Armorblox secures enterprise communications over email and other cloud office applications with the power of Natural Language Understanding. The Armorblox platform connects over APIs and analyzes thousands of signals to understand the context of communications and protect people and data from compromise.

The Armorblox API enables developers to build integrations with the Armorblox platform.

## Getting started

To start using our APIs, you will need your Armorblox tenant name and an API key.

#### Tenant name

Your Armorblox portal's URL looks like `https://yourtenantname.armorblox.io`. The `yourtenantname` part is needed to generate the correct API endpoints for use with all of our APIs.

#### API key

Steps to obtain an Armorblox API key:

1. Log into your Armorblox portal with your credentials.
2. In the portal, click **Settings**.
3. In the **Settings** view, click **API Keys.**
4. Click **Create API Key**.
5. Specify a descriptive name so that you know the purpose of this key for future reference.
6. Click **Create**, and copy the API key displayed in the modal. The key is only displayed once.
7. Save the API key securely.
    

Any such API keys should never be shared with anyone (other than internal Armorblox admins). The API key should be included with each API call in the request header.
