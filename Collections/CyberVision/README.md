# Cybervision

Getting Started  
The main way to visualize and use the data analyzed by the sensors is to use  
Cisco Cyber Vision webapp offering a map for visualization, a timeline for  
events inspection and a significant number of other features.  
The other way, explained in this document, is to use the Cisco Cyber Vision  
API. In this document, CCV refers to Cisco Cyber Vision.  
The API exposes the same data than the data used by the Cisco Cyber Vision  
webapp through an HTTP protocol, a REST API, to allow the creation of thirdparty clients, scripts and automation
